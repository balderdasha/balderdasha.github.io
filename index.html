Travel. I've been fortunate enough to have visited 35-odd countries in my quarter-of-a-century on this earth. The poem "Ithaca" by Cavafy, which 
is close to my heart, echoes my sentiments upon coming to a new place: 
"That the summer morns be many / when with what delight, what joy / you enter harbours hitherto unseen." The delight and joy I feel when familiarizing 
myself with a place hitherto unseen are unparalleled. And, the experiences I've had during this process are some of my most cherished memories—from being 
cajoled into buying heady perfumes in Egyptian cities, to taking in a stray dog in Ukraine. I'm lucky that my work allows me to prioritize travel and am 
always thinking about my next adventure.

            What is the quality you most like in a woman?

<p align=justify>
That she champions other women. I think Abby Wambach put it best in her <a class="link" href="https://barnard.edu/commencement/archives/2018/abby-wambach-remarks">remarks</a> 
at Barnard College's 2018 commencement. A queer, female soccer icon, she says supporting others' successes above our own may not come easily. Women have long been pitted against each other for a seat 
at the table, but "it is within our power to create abundance for women where scarcity used to live." I admire those women who go above and beyond to create 
this abundance.

I will admit to tearing up at all those Nike ads about female empowerment. Abby Wambach, Serena Williams, Simone Biles—just a few female athletes I look up to 
not only because they are shattering records, but also because they are paving the way for other women to do so after them. Use your own success as a platform to empower 
others, whether you're a world-renowned athlete, CEO, or teacher. And, celebrate each others' victories until there is a defeanening abundance of them. You never 
know who you might be providing with a seat at the table or inspiring to shatter the next record.

            When and where were you happiest?

I was happiest on September 9th, 2018. Having just moved to Greece on a Fulbright, my friends and I chose to escape the city for the weekend 
to a small island for sunbathing and swimming in the Saronic sea before the summer ended. On a whim we swam up to a boat anchored nearby and 
befriended the old Greek living on it; he didn't speak a word of English, but welcomed us aboard and made us fresh garlic bread, grilled up 
some meat, and taught us to make Greek salad. This hospitality was my first taste of a new home. Wine-buzzed and sun-baked, I didn't notice I 
had stepped on a sea urchin until long after we'd swum back to the pebble-covered shore. The end to this day consisted of my new friends gathered around 
me—one squeezing my hand, another removing urchin spines with a needle, a third and fourth distracting me with ukulele music and sheep facts—and my laughing 
at the absurdity of the entire situation. I was far from home, surrounded by people I was just starting to get to know, but full of hope for the adventure 
ahead. What a memorable start.

            What do you most value in your friends?

    <div class="subtitle">
<p align=justify>
A sense of adventure. I will be the person who plans an entire day and night of activites, and just want people along for the ride
(or who have suggestions of their own to make it even more fun for all of us). I especially value connections forged through shared 
experiences and memories. I appreciate people who will get excited about meeting up and doing something together, whether it's leaving the city for a hike 
or visiting an old museum with a new exhibition. I think truly getting to know people requires being with them in a variety of situations 
and settings; people get to know me best when I'm happiest and doing the things I love.

            What is your motto?

    <div class="subtitle">
<p align=justify>
Alfonso Cuarón's 2001 film, <i>Y Tu Mamá También</i>, ends on the line: 
"La vida es como la espuma, por eso hay que darse como el mar." Roughly translated, this means 
<i>life is like sea spray, so you must give yourself like the sea</i>. I choose to interpret this 
as hinting at the fleetingness of life (spoiler: the character who says this later dies of cancer), 
in the face of which we must choose to live forcefully. We never know the circumstances that might arise 
in our lives, but must bear on despite them—incessantly and ceaselessly like the sea.
